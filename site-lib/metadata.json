Eran is tired, he is upset.\nWhen Eran is not upset, he is not tired. If Eyal is happy, Anat is tall; and if Anat is tall, Haggai is cute.\nIf Eyal is happy, Haggai is cute. If I am vegan, then I eat quinoa and do not eat shawarma.\nI do not eat quinoa only if I am not vegan, and I also do not eat shawarma\nif I am vegan.\nThe next exercise deals with cards that have a symbol on both sides—an English\nletter on one side and a natural number on the other. Four cards are placed on the\ntable, showing the symbols A, P, 2, and 3. Which cards should be flipped to check\nthe statement ”If there is one of the letters AEIOU on one side of the card, then on\nthe other side, there is an even number”? Justify well (why the cards you suggested\nneed to be flipped, and why the other cards do not need to be checked).\nIf there is a letter A on one side, then on the other is a natural number. If it's even, the statement holds, if not, the statement is false, thus we have to flip this card.\nIf there is a letter P on one side, then on the other is a natural number, if it's odd, the statement holds, if it's even, the statement still holds, thus we don't have to flip that card.\nIf there is a number 2 on one side, then on the other is a letter. If it's one of A,E,I,O or U, the statement holds, if it's not, the statement still holds, thus we don't have to flip this card.\nIf there is a number 3 on one side, then on the other is a letter. If it's not one of A,E,I,O or U, the statement holds, if it is, the statement is false, thus we have to flip this card. If I am tired or hungry, then I am irritable.\nIf I am not irritable, then I am not tired.\nConclusion: I am tired if and only if I am irritable. If the sun is shining, then all the roosters are crowing.\nIf my rooster, Kuki, is crowing, then the sun is shining.\nConclusion: The sun shines if and only if all the roosters are crowing\nLet p, q be two statements such that the statement p → q has the value ”true.” In\nthis case, we say that p is a sufficient condition for q, and q is a necessary condition\nfor p. Formalize each of the following sections using appropriate predicates. In all\nsections, the ”world” is the natural numbers; there is no need to state this.For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is prime” is a sufficient condition for ”the number n is odd.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is prime and greater than 2” is a sufficient and necessary condition for ”the number n is odd.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is divisible by 4” is a sufficient condition for ”the number n is even.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is even” is a necessary condition for ”the number n is divisible by 4.”","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Academia","#Assignment","#Discrete-math"],"headers":[{"heading":"1a","level":2,"id":"1a_0"},{"heading":"1b","level":2,"id":"1b_0"},{"heading":"1c","level":2,"id":"1c_0"},{"heading":"1d","level":2,"id":"1d_0"},{"heading":"2a","level":2,"id":"2a_0"},{"heading":"2b","level":2,"id":"2b_0"},{"heading":"2c","level":2,"id":"2c_0"},{"heading":"3a","level":2,"id":"3a_0"},{"heading":"3b","level":2,"id":"3b_0"},{"heading":"3c","level":2,"id":"3c_0"},{"heading":"4","level":2,"id":"4_0"},{"heading":"5a","level":2,"id":"5a_0"},{"heading":"Alternative

Database Systems : The complete Book (2nd edition)\nSQL for Web nerds What is the goal of a database?\nStore the data\nUpdate the data\nFetch certain parts of the data\nDatabase Management SystemRelational DBMSWhat is a DBMS?\nA collection of files that store the data\nA system that manages the files does all the above\nCollection of Interfaces\nLet us try to implement a courses repository without using a DBMS\nWe need to store\nStudents\nProfessors\nCourses\nRelations between students and courses, professors and courses, etc.\nWe can do a naive file-storage system:students.txt\nID, name, course list courses.txt\nID, name, professor, students list professors.txt\nID, name, course list\nWhich basic problems are there?\nLists inside lists, complex data layout\nData duplication\nAmbiguous field names\nHard to update the data without rewriting the whole file\nWhat about the following:\nSystem crashes - how do we ensure data consistency in case of a crash in the middle of some operation?\nLarge data, e.g. 1Tb per file\nSimultaneous access by multiple users\nComplex queries - find all professors who teach some specific student that takes more first year classes than average, etc.\nAll, or almost all, of these problems have been addressed one way or another by existing DBMSs, with contributions of many excellent developers. Client tier - Clients connect to the DBMS and tell it what to do Server tier - Off-the-shelf program that manages data files, handles crashes, access control, concurrency, etc. Client tier send commands (queries) to Server tier and receives results Clients use some protocol to connect to the server and use a language to specify complex queries Relational DBMS\nIn the following notes we'll talk mainly about RDBMS\nAn example of such a language would be SQLSQL consists of two main parts\nData Definition language (DDL) - a way to define the structure of the data\nData Manipulation language (DML) - a way to work with the data\nData Control language (DCL) - a way to manage user permissions\nProcedural extensions (PS-SQL, etc.)\nIt is specifying WHAT to do, not HOW to do it\nThis allows the user to not know how the data management is done, only how to interact with a DBMS, which is, in most cases, much easier\nStart with defining structure of the data with DDLCREATE TABLE Students ( ID CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, Name CHAR(30), Degree CHAR(20), ...);\nAnd continue with DML to populate the dataINSERT INTO Students\nVALUES('123456789', 'Alice Jones', 'Undergraduate', ...);\nMultiple tables allow us to represent relations between different entities (tables)Where Takes is a relation table representing relation \"Student takes Course\"\nQuery/DML/DDL compiler - parse language and translate into logical execution steps\nOptimizer - optimize queries execution\nExecution engine\nStorage management\nTransaction management - concurrency and recovery Atomic types - int, char, date, etc.\nTable - each cell in a table contains one atomic value\nNo nesting, except when including a nested document as an atomic value, e.g. XML document Each record (row, tuple) is an ordered list of atomic values (and NULLs)\nEach table is an unordered bag of records, at least from the client perspective There can be duplicate records (theoretically)\nNo order (theoretically) A collection of atomic values in all records with the same name in the table is called a column\nNotation is as follows\nStudents(ID, Name, Degree)\nA key is an attribute or a set of attributes with unique value\nNo two records may have the same key\nThis can be explained as \"KEY defines ATTRIBUTES\", i.e. ID defines student name and degree\nClassrooms(Building, Room, Capacity, Projector)\nHere, key is a set of two attributes - building and room define classroom capacity and projector\nBasic form of a select query is as followsSELECT attributes\nFROM relations\nWHERE conditions for each record Usual meaning for numbers\nLexicographic order for CHAR and VARCHAR\nChronological ordering for dates and times Special functions Arithmetic operations on numbers\nPattern matching on text\nSpecial date functions\nDBMS dependent (specific) Clause connectives, e.g. AND, OR, etc.\nLIKE - pattern matching s LIKE p - s matches pattern p\np may contain two types of wildcards % - any sequence of characters\n_ - any single character Case sensitivity - depends on DBMS Select only distinct records, i.e.SELECT DISTINCT category\nFROM Product\nwill only return all distinct categories, without repetitions\nSelecting distinct multiple columns will result in all distinct combinations of these columnsSELECT pname, price, manufacturer\nFROM product\nWHERE category='Gadgets' AND price &gt; 50\nORDER BY price, pname DESC/ASC modifier to enforce descending/ascending order, ASC is the default\nOrder is lexicographic by columns\nOrdering is done in the post processing, after the resulting rows have been selected\nAdditionally, it is possible to add LIMIT n clause that limits the resulting set to n rows\nHow do we connect two or more tables in a query? We identify pairs of records that correspond to each other in different tables, e.g. by the value of some \"shared\" column\nProduct(pname, price, category, manufacturer)\nCompany(cname, stockprice, country)\nA basic example would be \"Find all products produced in Japan under 200$\"SELECT pname, price\nFROM Product, Company\nWHERE manufacturer=cname AND country='Japan' AND price &lt;= 200;\nAnother example \"Find all countries that manufacture some product in 'Gadgets' category\"SELECT country\nFROM Product, Company\nWHERE manufacturer=cname AND category='Gadgets'\nDoes this work properly? No! Join creates records containing columns from both tables, so in our case if there are multiple 'Gadgets' products produced in the same country, there will be multiple repetitions of that country in the answer. We need DISTINCT!SELECT DISTINCT country\nFROM Product, Company\nWHERE manufacturer=cname AND category='Gadgets'\nOne more example!\nProduct(pname, price, category, manufacturer)\nPurchase(buyer, seller, store, product)\nPerson(persname, phoneNumber, city)\n\"Find names of people living in Seattle that bought some product in the 'Gadgets' category, and the names of the stores from which they bought that product\"\nSELECT DISTINCT persname, store\nFROM Person, Purchase, Product\nWHERE persname=buyer AND product=pname AND city='Seattle' AND category='Gadgets'\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Academia","#Lecture","#Databases"],"headers":[{"heading":"DBMS ","level":2,"id":"DBMS_#definition_0"},{"heading":"RDBMS ","level":2,"id":"RDBMS_#definition_0"},{"heading":"DBMS structure","level":2,"id":"DBMS_structure_0"},{"heading":"Client tier","level":2,"id":"Client_tier_0"},{"heading":"SQL (Structured Query Language) ","level":3,"id":"SQL_(Structured_Query_Language)_#definition_0"},{"heading":"A declarative commands language","level":4,"id":"A_declarative_commands_language_0"},{"heading":"Server tier","level":2,"id":"Server_tier_0"},{"heading":"SQL","level":1,"id":"SQL_0"},{"heading":"SQL Data","level":2,"id":"SQL_Data_0"},{"heading":"SQL Tables","level":2,"id":"SQL_Tables_0"},{"heading":"SQL Queries","level":2,"id":"SQL_Queries_0"},{"heading":"Select","level":3,"id":"Select_0"},{"heading":"Where clause","level":3,"id":"Where_clause_0"},{"heading":"Distinct modifier","level":3,"id":"Distinct_modifier_0"},{"heading":"Order by clause","level":3,"id":"Order_by_clause_0"},{"heading":"Implicit joins (via FROM+WHERE clause)","level":3,"id":"Implicit_joins_(via_FROM+WHERE_clause)_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:definition","?query=tag:definition","?query=tag:definition"],"author":"Konstantin Ostashenko","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/databases/databases-01.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761724307169,"modifiedTime":1763483276963,"sourceSize":8055,"sourcePath":"Lectures/Databases/Databases 01.md","exportPath":"lectures/databases/databases-01.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":100,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"lectures/databases/databases-02.html":{"title":"Databases 02","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-file\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M15 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7Z\"></path><path d=\"M14 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4\"></path></svg>","description":"Manual joins are perfectly fine, but how can we define the tables to be joinable without manually specifying on which columns to join?

separate values, often countsNumerical, can take any real value within the intervalCategory-like values with no natural order, i.e. Cat, Dog, HorseOrdered categories-like, or in other words \"named-numerical\", i.e. grades - Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, Good, ExcellentWhen describing some quantitative data, we usually want to describe two things\nThe central tendency - where is data concentrated\nThe dispersion (spread) - how far do extremities reach\nIn probability theory, these correspond to expected value (mean) and dispersion\nSome single numerical value computed from a sample. This statistic summarizes some aspect of the data, i.e. center, spread, associationSummary statistic is called robust if small changes or few extreme observations have little influence on its value.The smallest fraction of the sample data that has to be replaced with an arbitrary extreme value in order to make the statistic take an arbitrary large (or small) value, i.e. the measure of how resistant statistic is to data contaminationSample variance measures the typical squared distance from the mean\nStandard deviation expresses this deviation in the same units as the data.Why not use absolute values instead of squares? The answer is - we usually prefer smooth functions over non-smooth ones.It is important to note that standard deviation is not robust, it is easily inflated by an extreme value.\nSquaring avoids cancellations between positive and negative differences\nSquaring emphasizes data points that are further from the mean Using gives us an unbiased estimate on the true population variance\nQuartile is each of the four equally-sized groups that the data sample can be divided into according to the distribution of a particular variable denotes the split-point of the first quartile from the rest (median of the lower half of the data) denotes the split-point of the fourth quartile from the rest (median of the higher half of the data)\nInterquartile range is then defined as a difference measures the spread of the central half of the data and is much less affected by outliers than the standard deviation.\nHence, is more robust than the standard deviationThe rule states the following:-based \"fences\" are robust - they depend on medians, not on extreme values\nFor symmetric, light-tailed data, For heavy-tailed or contaminated data, stays stable, while can explode\n12345ValueFrequency0-22-44-66-88-10HistogramWhen plotting histograms, it is important to keep the number of bins balanced, as to not hide the overall pattern\nCommon choices for bin width

quantile is the median\nFor and the quantiles are respectively A horizontal shift between two ECDFs indicates a difference in location - the dataset whose ECDF is to the right tends to have larger values\nA difference in steepness (a slope of steps) indicates a difference in spread - the steeper ECDF corresponds to a more concentrated distribution\nIf one ECDF is consistently below the other, one sample tends to produce larger observations (stochastic dominance) Positive - both grow\nNegative - one grows, another falls\nNone - no visible pattern\nSpurious - both depend on some hidden factor\nTo show these relations visually, we can use the Scatterplot Horizontal axis shows one variable (sometimes called an explanatory variable)\nVertical axis shows the other variable (sometimes called a response variable)\nThe overall pattern reveals direction, form, and strength of the relationship\nAn example of a positive relationship on a scatterplot:\nHoursStudiedExamScore1234567891012345678910ScatterplotNote that scatterplots only show association, not causation(!!!)\nSometimes we wish to quantify the relationship with a single number instead.\nThe numerator measures how and move together\nThe denominator rescales it so that Note that non-linear trends cannot be observed using the sample correlation coefficient!\nHaving an observable trend, we can try to predict the value of a response variable given the value of an explanatory variable\nLet us discuss linear trends and, correspondingly, linear regression.\nWe can make predictions using the fitted lineGiven a linear trend, a fitted line is a line that summarizes this trend, i.e. captures it's central tendency, not the details.\nThe fitted line provides the prediction value for each The difference between the actual value and the predicted one is called residual, Residual measures how far the actual data points are from the fitted line\nTo obtain the best fitted line we use algebraic regression, so called least-squares fit, the goal of this regression is to minimize the sum of squared residuals.Coefficient of determination is defined as follows is the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the fitted line For simple regression, The higher the coefficient of determination, the better predictive ability. measures the linear association, measures how well the fitted line fits.\nUsing a scatterplot of residuals against fitted values , we can analyze the pattern they form and verify whether a fitted line is appropriate for the data.\nIf residuals are random, scattered around 0, then the line fits well\nA pattern (curve, funnel, etc.) indicates problems - nonlinearity or heteroscedasticity\nIf the pattern is observed, it is possible that applying a variable transformation would help, i.e. If not, a nonlinear model is probably necessary\nBut what if a pattern is not really a curve, funnel, etc., but a changing spread, meaning there is a relation between and ?\nIn this case, transformation or a weighted least-squares fit might help\nIf not, we can still fallback to a nonlinear modelThe least-squares fit uses squared deviations, this means that one large error ahs a huge impact on the total\nOutliers can distort both and the correlation Outliers might also inflate or deflate The most important thing here is to perform a data cleanup - fixing or removing data errors\nIf the outlier is in fact an actual value and not a data error - use robust regression

- starting Node Each Node has a left, and a right \"child\" - another Node Left child is always \"smaller\" than the parent\nRight child is always \"greater\" than the parent Node without children is called a Leaf Repetitions are usually not allowed\nThis structure forms an ever widening tree-like pattern Branch is a \"path\" from the root to one of the leaves Tree is called balanced if length of all it's branches is the same, in this case, length of branches is called the Height of the tree This operation is usually recursive, stepping to the left or to the right each call until we find the Node or get to a leafpublic Node searchBST(Node root, Node toFind) { if (root == null) { return root; } if (toFind == root) { return root; } else if (toFind &lt; root) { return this.searchBST(root.left, toFind); } else { return this.searchBST(root.right, toFind); }\n}\nThis operation is usually recursive, stepping to the left or to the right each call until we get to the leafpublic Node insertNodeBST(Node root, Node new) { if (root == null) { // new becomes root return new; } if (new &lt; root) { root.left = this.insertNodeBST(root.left, new); } else if (new &gt; root) { root.left = this.insertNodeBST(root.right, new); } return root;\n}\nThis operation is usually recursive, searching for an element to delete and, when found, adjusting tree as follows:\nIf the Node to delete has one child - it is just replaced by it\nIf the Node has two children - it's immediate successor replaces it\npublic Node removeNodeBST(Node root, Node toDelete) if (!root) { return root; } if (toDelete &lt; root) { root.left = removeNodeBST(root.left, toDelete); } else if (toDelete &gt; root) { root.right = removeNodeBST(root.right, toDelete); } else { // one right child or zero children if (root.left == null) { return root.right; } // one left child or zero children if (root.right == null) { return root.left; } // two children Node successor = root.right; while (successor.left) { successor = successor.left; } // copy successor data to root root.data = successor.data; // delete successor root.right = removeNodeBST(root.right, successor); } return root; InOrder Traversal (Left, Root, Right) - visits nodes in ascending order, sorted so to say\nPreOrder Traversal (Root, Left, Right) - useful for creating a copy of the tree\nPostOrder Traversal (Left, Right, Root) - used for deleting the tree efficiently\nBST traversals are usually recursive but can be implemented using a stack instead\nConcatenation is the process of merging two BSTs, T1​ and T2​, into a single BST while preserving the BST property.\nConditions:\nGiven two BSTs: T1​ contains elements smaller than all elements in T2​.\nT2​ contains elements greater than all elements in T1​. An optional pivot element may be provided to maintain balance. Find the maximum element in T1​. Remove this maximum element from T1​.\nMake the removed element the new root. Attach T1 as the left subtree and T2 as the right subtree. Start at the root of the taller tree (let’s say T1​).\nTraverse down the right spine until reaching a node where the height of the subtree matches that of T2​.\nAttach T2​ as the right child of this node.\nRebalance the tree if necessary.\nSplitting a BST means dividing it into two separate BSTs based on a given split value x. The goal is:\nT1​ should contain all elements ≤ x.\nT2​ should contain all elements &gt; x. Search for x in the BST: If x exists, remove it and make it a pivot.\nIf x doesn’t exist, proceed with the nearest node. Recursive Splitting: If x is smaller than the root: Recursively split the left subtree. Attach the right subtree of the split to the right subtree of the root. If x is larger than the root: Recursively split the right subtree. Attach the left subtree of the split to the left subtree of the root. Balancing Step (if needed): If an AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree is used, rebalancing may be required.
