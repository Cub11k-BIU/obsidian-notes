The insurance company believes that all people are divided into two categories - accident prone ones and not accident prone ones. Accident prone ones are considered to be of population.
Accident prone ones have probability of to have at least one accident in the next year.
Not accident prone ones have probability of to have an accident in the next year.
What is the probability of some new client having an accident in the next year?Let us now assume that the new client had an accident last year. What is the probability of him being accident prone?Let there be a deck of n distinct cards. One player is opening cards one by one. Second player has an opportunity to call one card (the next one) to be a card . Is there a specific moment in which the second player should call the next card?Let there be a multiple choice question with possible answers
Student knows the correct answer with probability In case the student doesn't know the answer, he takes a guess, with probability he gives a correct answer.
What is the probability of student actually knowing the correct answer if he answered correctly?Let there be some blood test for disease With probability it detects a disease if it is present (true positive)
With probability it detects a disease if it is not present (false positive) of population have the disease
What is the probability of a person having the disease if the test is positive?Professor studies disease Professor has a dilemma:
If he is at least certain that his patient has disease - he immediately performs the surgery
If he is less than certain - he asks to do some additional expensive testing
Let there be a new diabetic patient, professor was certain that he has disease Patient took the test and got the positive result
The test always gives true positives, and gives false positives
Should the professor perform surgery or perform more tests? Let's take a previous example of cards game
There are cards, excluding card There are different orders of these cardsLet there be a plane is missing.
There are three different disjoint areas - If the plane is in region , we can locate it with probability We tried to find it in area and we didn't succeed.
What is the probability of the plane being in area ]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/probability/probability-04.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Probability/Probability 04.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:26:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Databases 04]]></title><description><![CDATA[LAG(return_value [, offset[, default_value]]) returns the value offset steps before the current value in order, or the default

Using (virtual) views in FROM clause is convenient, but not efficient, it is translated into a subquery!CTE is defined by WITH clause, and is similar to view, but there are some differences
Syntax - WITH [RECURSIVE] name AS (result set)Given a relation
ParentChild(parent, child)
Return, for each person, all of their ancestors.
It is clear, that with an unknown number of ancestry depth, we must use recursion
Is it possible in SQL? With CTEs - yes!
WITH RECURSIVE Ancestry(person, ancestor) AS ( -- base case SELECT child AS person, parent AS ancestor FROM ParentChild UNION ALL -- recursive call, including stopping condition (empty JOIN) SELECT Ancestry.person, ParentChild.parent FROM Ancestry JOIN ParentChild ON Ancestry.anscestor = Parentchild.child
)
SELECT *
FROM Ancestry
Another example,
Calculate WITH RECURSIVE Factorial AS ( SELECT 1 AS n, 1 AS value UNION ALL SELECT n+1 AS n, value*(n+1) AS value FROM Factorial WHERE n &lt; 5
)
SELECT n, value AS 'n!'
FROM Factorial
Another example,
Employee(id, name, manager_id)
Compute the employee hierarchy level (boss is on the first level)
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS ( SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level FROM Employee WHERE manager_id IS NULL UNION ALL SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, e.level+1 AS level FROM Employee AS e JOIN EmployeeHierarchy AS eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT id, name, level

Another example,
Employee(id, name, manager_id)
How many employees are under management of each employee?

Columns used in GROUP BY can be present in the result set as is, but don't have to
Any other columns must only be used in some aggregate
SELECT product, SUM(price*quantity) AS salesPerProduct
FROM Purchase
WHERE date &gt;= '2020.01.01'
GROUP BY product
This query will return sum of sales since 2020 for each product
Some GROUP BY queries can be written without GROUP BY using sub-queries, although it is not really usefulHAVING clause is used in combination with GROUP BY and is roughly equivalent to WHERE for each group created by GROUP BY instead of a condition for the whole tableSELECT product, MAX(price) AS maxPrice
FROM Purchase
WHERE date &gt;= '2020.01.01'
GROUP BY product
HAVING MAX(price) &lt; 100 AND MIN(price) &gt; 10
Using HAVING without aggregation is usually pointless as it can be done with WHERE or a sub-query, or can have unexpected results, different from defining conditions on the whole tableQuote from Wikipedia
WHERE is taken into account at an earlier stage of a query execution, filtering the rows read from the tables. If a query contains GROUP BY, rows from the tables are grouped and aggregated. After the aggregating operation, HAVING is applied, filtering out the rows that don't match the specified conditions. Therefore, WHERE applies to data read from tables, and HAVING should only apply to aggregated data, which isn't known in the initial stage of a query. Author(login, name)
Wrote(login, title)
Find names of authors who wrote at least 10 documents
SELECT Author.name
FROM Author, Wrote
WHERE Author.login = Wrote.login
GROUP BY Author.login, Author.name
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= 10
Find the maximal number of articles that any author wroteSELECT MAX(nums.numArticles) AS maxArticles
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS numArticles FROM Wrote GROUP BY Wrote.login) AS nums
orSELECT COUNT(*) AS maxArticles
FROM Wrote
GROUP BY Wrote.login
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= ALL (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Wrote GROUP BY Wrote.login)
NULL is a missing or unknown atomic value in the table
We can either allow NULLs or prohibit them in the table/column
Selection, is NULL = 2?
Distinct, are two NULLs distinct or not?
Joins, are two NULLs equal or not?
Intersect, are two NULLs equal or not?
...
To solve this problem, in SQL there are three(!) boolean values:
FALSE = 0
UNKNOWN = 0.5 (conceptually)
TRUE = 1
UNKNOWN is used specifically for comparisons with NULL AND TRUE AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
FALSE AND UNKNOWN = FALSE
UNKNOWN AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN OR TRUE OR UNKNOWN = TRUE
FALSE OR UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
UNKNOWN OR UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN NOT
- NOT UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
These can be interpreted (conceptually) as:
x AND y = min(x, y)
x OR y = max(x, y)
NOT x = 1 - x
Rows with the value of WHERE condition being UNKNOWN will not be returned
Operators IS NULL and IS NOT NULL check exactly what is written
If a value is equal (not equal) to NULL, then it returns TRUE, otherwise FALSEBenefits
Explicitly define join criteria and distinguish them from selection criteria
Avoid bugs like unintended cartesian products (i.e. forgotten join clause in WHERE)
SELECT Product.name, Purchase.store
FROM Product JOIN Purchase ON Product.name = Purchase.prodName
is equivalent toSELECT Product.name, Purchase.store
FROM Product, Purchase
WHERE Product.name = Purchase.prodName
Outer joins include rows from the first table that did not match any rows from the second table
LEFT OUTER JOIN, LEFT JOIN - for each rows on the left do a regular join if there is a match, or match with a row of NULLs from the right table
RIGHT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN - same as LEFT OUTER JOIN but symmetric
FULL OUTER JOIN - include non-matching rows from both left and right tables Missing from MySQL, but can be emulated INNER JOIN, JOIN - same as implicit join (with a joining condition!) Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Purchase(buyer, seller, store, product)
Company(cname, stockPrice, country)
Find people who bought anything from Lucy or bought products from a company whose stock price is over $50
SELECT DISTINCT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname JOIN Company AS c ON p.manufacturer = c.cname
WHERE pur.seller = 'Lucy' OR c.stockPrice &gt; 50
Let's talk about the last query, there is a problem:
What if we have a NULL somewhere?
Conditions in OR are asymmetric, that is they examine different tables, and they should not depend on the contents of other tables when joining. Any failure in the joining chain would break the query
Let's try using LEFT OUTER JOIN to eliminate this problem!SELECT DISTINCT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur LEFT JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname LEFT JOIN Company AS c ON p.manufacturer = c.cname
WHERE pur.seller = 'Lucy' OR c.stockPrice &gt; 50
Or by using UNION:(SELECT pur.buyer FROM Purchase AS pur WHERE pur.seller = 'Lucy') UNION
(SELECT pur.buyer FROM Purchase AS pur JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname JOIN Company AS c ON p.manufacturer = c.cname WHERE c.stockPrice &gt; 50)
Switch case clause in SQLSELECT product, CASE WHEN price &lt; 1500 THEN 'Low price' WHEN price BETWEEN 1500 AND 2000 THEN 'Medium price' WHEN price &gt; 2000 THEN 'High price' ELSE 'Unknown' END AS PriceCategory
...
Choose the first non-NULL value from the listSELECT COALESCE(p.category, 'misc') AS category, SUM(price*quantity) AS totalSales
FROM Purchase AS pur LEFT JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname
GROUP BY COALESCE(p.category, 'misc') Purchase(pid, buyer, seller, product, date, price)
For each purchase, calculate the sum of all previous purchases of the same buyer
SELECT pur1.pid, COALESCE((SELECT SUM(pur2.price) FROM Purchase AS pur2 WHERE pur2.buyer = pur1.buyer AND pur2.date &lt; pur1.date ), 0) AS previousTotal
FROM Purchase AS pur1
Can we do this some other way?
For each row, open a "window" to other related rows
Similar to aggregate functions, but return a value for each row instead of each group
SELECT col1, col2, window_function(...) OVER([PARTITION BY] [ORDER BY]) AS new_column
FROM TableName window_function() can be an aggregate function or some other: RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUM, NTILE, LAG, LEAD OVER defines the window
- PARTITION BY (Optional) defines the associated group for each row
- ORDER BY (Optional) sets the order. When used, the window often ends with the current transaction
Previous query then becomes
SELECT pid, SUM(price) OVER ( PARTITION BY buyer ORDER BY date RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING AND 1 PRECEEDING ) AS previousTotal
FROM Purchase
Another example is
Student(name, dept, avgGrade, ...)
Find all the number one and two students with the highest average in each department. Include ties
SELECT ptable.name
FROM (SELECT name, dept, avgGrade, DENSE_RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY avgGrade DESC ) AS studentRank FROM Student) as ptable
WHERE ptable.studentRank &lt;= 2

The answer is foreign keys.
A column that is a reference to the key of another table, i.e. Product.manufacturer &lt;- Company.cname
Gives information and enforces constraints
SELECT *
FROM Department, Faculty
Yields the cartesian product of two tables, i.e. SELECT *
FROM Department, Faculty
WHERE dfaculty=fname
Yields the cartesian product with some constraints, i.e. SELECT R.A
FROM R, S, T
WHERE R.A=S.A OR R.A=T.A
Seemingly, we're looking for But what happens when one or tables are empty, i.e. T? Cartesian product is then also empty! So the query is not equivalent to Sometimes two relations have the same name for one or more columns. In this case, we're supposed to use the relation name to disambiguate the attribute, i.e. Person.address, Company.address instead of just address, addressQuestion - find all stores that sold at least one product that BestBuy store also sold?
Proposed query:SELECT DISTINCT store
FROM Purchase
WHERE store = 'BestBuy'
This query is obviously wrong, as it only returns BestBuy itself
We encounter a problem - we have to match two or more different rows on the same column in the same table
The solution is a self-join!SELECT DISTINCT store
FROM Purchase, Purchase
WHERE product = product AND store = 'BestBuy'
The problem is that all columns are now ambiguous
The solution to this problem is aliasing, or ASSELECT DISTINCT x.store
FROM Purchase AS x, Purchase AS y
WHERE x.product = y.product AND y.store = 'BestBuy'
And now the query actually works. The only question is - do we want to return BestBuy itself or not?SELECT DISTINCT x.store
FROM Purchase AS x, Purchase AS y
WHERE x.product = y.product AND y.store = 'BestBuy' AND x.store &lt;&gt; 'BestBuy'
It is also possible to rename attributes (columns) in the SELECT resulting table
Scope of the created "variable" is the entire query (for now)
Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Purchase(buyer, seller, store, product)
Company(cname, stockPrice, country)
Person(pername, phoneNumber, city)
Find all people who bought telephony productsSELECT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur, Product AS pr
WHERE pur.product = pr.pname AND pr.category = 'telephony'
Find names of people who bought American productsSELECT DISTINCT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur, Product AS pr, Company AS c
WHERE pur.product = pr.pname AND pr.manufacturer = c.cname AND c.country = 'USA'
Find names of people who bought American products and they live in SeattleSELECT DISTINCT per.pername
FROM Person AS per, Purchase AS pur, Product AS pr, Company AS c
WHERE per.pername = pur.buyer AND pur.product = pr.pname AND pr.manufacturer = c.cname AND c.country = 'USA' AND per.city = 'Seattle'
Find people who have both bought and sold somethingSELECT DISTINCT buy.buyer
FROM Purchase AS buy, Purchase AS sell
WHERE buy.buyer = sell.seller
Find a purchase involving a person from Seattle and a person from TokyoSELECT DISTINCT buy.buyer AS 'buyer', buy.seller AS 'seller', buy.store AS 'store', buy.product AS 'product'
FROM Purchase AS pur, Person AS buy, Person AS sell
WHERE pur.buyer = buy.pername AND pur.seller = sell.pername AND ( (buy.city = 'Seattle' AND sell.city = 'Tokyo') OR (buy.city = 'Tokyo' AND sell.city = 'Seattle') )
Union of two result tables with equal columns(!)
UNION returns distinct entries by default, use UNION ALL to keep them
Example, select all people who live in Seattle or bought something from BestBuy(SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle') UNION
(SELECT buyer as name FROM Purchase WHERE store='BestBuy')
Difference of two result tables with equal columns(!)
EXCEPT returns distinct entries
Example, select all people who live in Seattle and didn't buy anything from BestBuy(SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle') EXCEPT
(SELECT buyer as name FROM Purchase WHERE store='BestBuy')
Intersection of two result tables with equal columns(!)
INTERSECT returns distinct entries
Example, select all people who live in Seattle and bought something from BestBuy(SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle') INTERSECT
(SELECT buyer as name FROM Purchase WHERE store='BestBuy')
Subquery can be treated as an atomic value if and only if it returns a one-row and one-column resultSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.buyer = (SELECT name FROM Person WHERE ID = '123456789')
Checking if a value exists in the set
Subquery can return any number of results, but no errorSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.buyer IN (SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle')
Subquery can also return multiple columnsSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE (Purchase.buyer, Purchase.store) IN (SELECT name, city FROM Person)
Quantifying over a subquery, i.e. Subquery must return a one-column resultSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.price &gt;= ALL (SELECT price FROM Purchase)
Quantifying over a subquery, i.e. Subquery must return a one-column resultSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.price &gt; ANY (SELECT price FROM Purchase)
Quantifying over a subquery, i.e. subquery is non-empty (or empty)SELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Person WHERE store=city); SELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Person WHERE store=city);
Usage
Note that these clauses can be used almost everywhere, not just as part of a WHERE clause
More specifically, in WHERE, FROM, SELECT and HAVING
When added to a simple SELECT-FROM-WHERE query:
Computed over the result set
returns a single value (one row)
SQL supports the following:
SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG - single column
COUNT - any number of columns, counts only rows COUNT(DISTINCT ...) counts only rows, distinct by columns in ... ]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/databases/databases-02.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Databases/Databases 02.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Databases 01]]></title><description><![CDATA[Books Database Systems : The complete Book (2nd edition)
SQL for Web nerds What is the goal of a database?
Store the data
Update the data
Fetch certain parts of the data
Database Management SystemRelational DBMSWhat is a DBMS?
A collection of files that store the data
A system that manages the files does all the above
Collection of Interfaces
Let us try to implement a courses repository without using a DBMS
We need to store
Students
Professors
Courses
Relations between students and courses, professors and courses, etc.
We can do a naive file-storage system:students.txt
ID, name, course list courses.txt
ID, name, professor, students list professors.txt
ID, name, course list
Which basic problems are there?
Lists inside lists, complex data layout
Data duplication
Ambiguous field names
Hard to update the data without rewriting the whole file
What about the following:
System crashes - how do we ensure data consistency in case of a crash in the middle of some operation?
Large data, e.g. 1Tb per file
Simultaneous access by multiple users
Complex queries - find all professors who teach some specific student that takes more first year classes than average, etc.
All, or almost all, of these problems have been addressed one way or another by existing DBMSs, with contributions of many excellent developers. Client tier - Clients connect to the DBMS and tell it what to do Server tier - Off-the-shelf program that manages data files, handles crashes, access control, concurrency, etc. Client tier send commands (queries) to Server tier and receives results Clients use some protocol to connect to the server and use a language to specify complex queries Relational DBMS
In the following notes we'll talk mainly about RDBMS
An example of such a language would be SQLSQL consists of two main parts
Data Definition language (DDL) - a way to define the structure of the data
Data Manipulation language (DML) - a way to work with the data
Data Control language (DCL) - a way to manage user permissions
Procedural extensions (PS-SQL, etc.)
It is specifying WHAT to do, not HOW to do it
This allows the user to not know how the data management is done, only how to interact with a DBMS, which is, in most cases, much easier
Start with defining structure of the data with DDLCREATE TABLE Students ( ID CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, Name CHAR(30), Degree CHAR(20), ...);
And continue with DML to populate the dataINSERT INTO Students
VALUES('123456789', 'Alice Jones', 'Undergraduate', ...);
Multiple tables allow us to represent relations between different entities (tables)Where Takes is a relation table representing relation "Student takes Course"
Query/DML/DDL compiler - parse language and translate into logical execution steps
Optimizer - optimize queries execution
Execution engine
Storage management
Transaction management - concurrency and recovery Atomic types - int, char, date, etc.
Table - each cell in a table contains one atomic value
No nesting, except when including a nested document as an atomic value, e.g. XML document Each record (row, tuple) is an ordered list of atomic values (and NULLs)
Each table is an unordered bag of records, at least from the client perspective There can be duplicate records (theoretically)
No order (theoretically) A collection of atomic values in all records with the same name in the table is called a column
Notation is as follows
Students(ID, Name, Degree)
A key is an attribute or a set of attributes with unique value
No two records may have the same key
This can be explained as "KEY defines ATTRIBUTES", i.e. ID defines student name and degree
Classrooms(Building, Room, Capacity, Projector)
Here, key is a set of two attributes - building and room define classroom capacity and projector
Basic form of a select query is as followsSELECT attributes
FROM relations
WHERE conditions for each record Usual meaning for numbers
Lexicographic order for CHAR and VARCHAR
Chronological ordering for dates and times Special functions Arithmetic operations on numbers
Pattern matching on text
Special date functions
DBMS dependent (specific) Clause connectives, e.g. AND, OR, etc.
LIKE - pattern matching s LIKE p - s matches pattern p
p may contain two types of wildcards % - any sequence of characters
_ - any single character Case sensitivity - depends on DBMS Select only distinct records, i.e.SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM Product
will only return all distinct categories, without repetitions
Selecting distinct multiple columns will result in all distinct combinations of these columnsSELECT pname, price, manufacturer
FROM product
WHERE category='Gadgets' AND price &gt; 50
ORDER BY price, pname DESC/ASC modifier to enforce descending/ascending order, ASC is the default
Order is lexicographic by columns
Ordering is done in the post processing, after the resulting rows have been selected
Additionally, it is possible to add LIMIT n clause that limits the resulting set to n rows
How do we connect two or more tables in a query? We identify pairs of records that correspond to each other in different tables, e.g. by the value of some "shared" column
Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Company(cname, stockprice, country)
A basic example would be "Find all products produced in Japan under 200$"SELECT pname, price
FROM Product, Company
WHERE manufacturer=cname AND country='Japan' AND price &lt;= 200;
Another example "Find all countries that manufacture some product in 'Gadgets' category"SELECT country
FROM Product, Company
WHERE manufacturer=cname AND category='Gadgets'
Does this work properly? No! Join creates records containing columns from both tables, so in our case if there are multiple 'Gadgets' products produced in the same country, there will be multiple repetitions of that country in the answer. We need DISTINCT!SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM Product, Company
WHERE manufacturer=cname AND category='Gadgets'
One more example!
Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Purchase(buyer, seller, store, product)
Person(persname, phoneNumber, city)
"Find names of people living in Seattle that bought some product in the 'Gadgets' category, and the names of the stores from which they bought that product"
SELECT DISTINCT persname, store
FROM Person, Purchase, Product
WHERE persname=buyer AND product=pname AND city='Seattle' AND category='Gadgets'

Root - starting Node Each Node has a left, and a right "child" - another Node Left child is always "smaller" than the parent
Right child is always "greater" than the parent Node without children is called a Leaf Repetitions are usually not allowed
This structure forms an ever widening tree-like pattern Branch is a "path" from the root to one of the leaves Tree is called balanced if length of all it's branches is the same, in this case, length of branches is called the Height of the tree This operation is usually recursive, stepping to the left or to the right each call until we find the Node or get to a leafpublic Node searchBST(Node root, Node toFind) { if (root == null) { return root; } if (toFind == root) { return root; } else if (toFind &lt; root) { return this.searchBST(root.left, toFind); } else { return this.searchBST(root.right, toFind); }
}
This operation is usually recursive, stepping to the left or to the right each call until we get to the leafpublic Node insertNodeBST(Node root, Node new) { if (root == null) { // new becomes root return new; } if (new &lt; root) { root.left = this.insertNodeBST(root.left, new); } else if (new &gt; root) { root.left = this.insertNodeBST(root.right, new); } return root;
}
This operation is usually recursive, searching for an element to delete and, when found, adjusting tree as follows:
If the Node to delete has one child - it is just replaced by it
If the Node has two children - it's immediate successor replaces it
public Node removeNodeBST(Node root, Node toDelete) if (!root) { return root; } if (toDelete &lt; root) { root.left = removeNodeBST(root.left, toDelete); } else if (toDelete &gt; root) { root.right = removeNodeBST(root.right, toDelete); } else { // one right child or zero children if (root.left == null) { return root.right; } // one left child or zero children if (root.right == null) { return root.left; } // two children Node successor = root.right; while (successor.left) { successor = successor.left; } // copy successor data to root root.data = successor.data; // delete successor root.right = removeNodeBST(root.right, successor); } return root; InOrder Traversal (Left, Root, Right) - visits nodes in ascending order, sorted so to say
PreOrder Traversal (Root, Left, Right) - useful for creating a copy of the tree
PostOrder Traversal (Left, Right, Root) - used for deleting the tree efficiently
BST traversals are usually recursive but can be implemented using a stack instead
Concatenation is the process of merging two BSTs, T1​ and T2​, into a single BST while preserving the BST property.
Conditions:
Given two BSTs: T1​ contains elements smaller than all elements in T2​.
T2​ contains elements greater than all elements in T1​. An optional pivot element may be provided to maintain balance. Find the maximum element in T1​. Remove this maximum element from T1​.
Make the removed element the new root. Attach T1 as the left subtree and T2 as the right subtree. Start at the root of the taller tree (let’s say T1​).
Traverse down the right spine until reaching a node where the height of the subtree matches that of T2​.
Attach T2​ as the right child of this node.
Rebalance the tree if necessary.
Splitting a BST means dividing it into two separate BSTs based on a given split value x. The goal is:
T1​ should contain all elements ≤ x.
T2​ should contain all elements &gt; x. Search for x in the BST: If x exists, remove it and make it a pivot.
If x doesn’t exist, proceed with the nearest node. Recursive Splitting: If x is smaller than the root: Recursively split the left subtree. Attach the right subtree of the split to the right subtree of the root. If x is larger than the root: Recursively split the right subtree. Attach the left subtree of the split to the left subtree of the root. Balancing Step (if needed): If an AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree is used, rebalancing may be required. ]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/data-structures/data-structures-03.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Data-structures/Data-structures 03.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:27:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-structures 02]]></title><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/data-structures/data-structures-02.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Data-structures/Data-structures 02.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:27:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-structures 01]]></title><description><![CDATA[i = 1 # 1 time

The central tendency - where is data concentrated
The dispersion (spread) - how far do extremities reach
In probability theory, these correspond to expected value (mean) and dispersion
Some single numerical value computed from a sample. This statistic summarizes some aspect of the data, i.e. center, spread, associationSummary statistic is called robust if small changes or few extreme observations have little influence on its value.The smallest fraction of the sample data that has to be replaced with an arbitrary extreme value in order to make the statistic take an arbitrary large (or small) value, i.e. the measure of how resistant statistic is to data contaminationSample variance measures the typical squared distance from the mean
Standard deviation expresses this deviation in the same units as the data.Why not use absolute values instead of squares? The answer is - we usually prefer smooth functions over non-smooth ones.It is important to note that standard deviation is not robust, it is easily inflated by an extreme value.
Squaring avoids cancellations between positive and negative differences
Squaring emphasizes data points that are further from the mean Using gives us an unbiased estimate on the true population variance
Quartile is each of the four equally-sized groups that the data sample can be divided into according to the distribution of a particular variable denotes the split-point of the first quartile from the rest (median of the lower half of the data) denotes the split-point of the fourth quartile from the rest (median of the higher half of the data)
Interquartile range is then defined as a difference measures the spread of the central half of the data and is much less affected by outliers than the standard deviation.
Hence, is more robust than the standard deviationThe rule states the following:-based "fences" are robust - they depend on medians, not on extreme values
For symmetric, light-tailed data, For heavy-tailed or contaminated data, stays stable, while can explode

Common choices for bin width (and consequently the number of bins)

For and the quantiles are respectively A horizontal shift between two ECDFs indicates a difference in location - the dataset whose ECDF is to the right tends to have larger values
A difference in steepness (a slope of steps) indicates a difference in spread - the steeper ECDF corresponds to a more concentrated distribution
If one ECDF is consistently below the other, one sample tends to produce larger observations (stochastic dominance) Positive - both grow
Negative - one grows, another falls
None - no visible pattern
Spurious - both depend on some hidden factor
To show these relations visually, we can use the Scatterplot Horizontal axis shows one variable (sometimes called an explanatory variable)
Vertical axis shows the other variable (sometimes called a response variable)
The overall pattern reveals direction, form, and strength of the relationship
An example of a positive relationship on a scatterplot:
HoursStudiedExamScore1234567891012345678910ScatterplotNote that scatterplots only show association, not causation(!!!)
Sometimes we wish to quantify the relationship with a single number instead.
The numerator measures how and move together
The denominator rescales it so that Note that non-linear trends cannot be observed using the sample correlation coefficient!
Having an observable trend, we can try to predict the value of a response variable given the value of an explanatory variable
Let us discuss linear trends and, correspondingly, linear regression.
We can make predictions using the fitted lineGiven a linear trend, a fitted line is a line that summarizes this trend, i.e. captures it's central tendency, not the details.
The fitted line provides the prediction value for each The difference between the actual value and the predicted one is called residual, Residual measures how far the actual data points are from the fitted line
To obtain the best fitted line we use algebraic regression, so called least-squares fit, the goal of this regression is to minimize the sum of squared residuals.Coefficient of determination is defined as follows is the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the fitted line For simple regression, The higher the coefficient of determination, the better predictive ability. measures the linear association, measures how well the fitted line fits.
Using a scatterplot of residuals against fitted values , we can analyze the pattern they form and verify whether a fitted line is appropriate for the data.
If residuals are random, scattered around 0, then the line fits well
A pattern (curve, funnel, etc.) indicates problems - nonlinearity or heteroscedasticity
If the pattern is observed, it is possible that applying a variable transformation would help, i.e. If not, a nonlinear model is probably necessary
But what if a pattern is not really a curve, funnel, etc., but a changing spread, meaning there is a relation between and ?
In this case, transformation or a weighted least-squares fit might help
If not, we can still fallback to a nonlinear modelThe least-squares fit uses squared deviations, this means that one large error ahs a huge impact on the total
Outliers can distort both and the correlation Outliers might also inflate or deflate The most important thing here is to perform a data cleanup - fixing or removing data errors
If the outlier is in fact an actual value and not a data error - use robust regression models

Single-destination shortest paths problem - find a shortest path to a given destination from every vertex Single-pair shortest path problem - find a shortest path from source to destination All-pairs shortest paths problem - find a shortest path between any two vertices We will focus on a single-destination variation
Shortest path lemma from previous lecture (BFS, DFS) also applies here in a more general form: Let us first define a function calculating the minimal distance in the following way:This function only works for acyclic(!) graphs, and runs in Similar solution with the same complexity is to first perform the topological sort and then go in that order instead of a random one.What can we do with cycles?
Cycles can be classified:
Negatively weighted cycle, this would mean that we can achieve distance, problematic
Zero-weighted cycle, this cycle can just be ignored as it doesn't affect the distance
Positively-weighted cycle, a "regular" cycle, can also be ignored
Let's assume we have no negative cyclesInitialize all vertices to have a distance estimateFor each edge in , relaxing an edge means checking whether an edge can improve the current shortest path, and thus should be usedAlgorithm runs in Assume we have no negative weighted edges.
Dijkstra's algorithm maintains a set of vertices that have their shortest paths from already determined. The algorithm then repeatedly selects with the minimum distance estimate (relaxation technique), adds to and relaxes all edges from Note that updates the key in , so it has to also call , which makes it for binary heap min queue instead of If using binary heap min queue, the runtime is If using Fibonacci heap min queue, the runtime is ]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/algorithms-1/algorithms-1-04.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Algorithms-1/Algorithms-1 04.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:27:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Algorithms-1 01]]></title><description><![CDATA[What would be the complexity of this algorithm?How do we address this?What would be the complexity of this algorithm?We should probably generalize thisWhy is it interesting to us?

Equivalence relation - reflexive, symmetric, transitive
Partial order - reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive
Full order - partial order and Examples or orders include Injective - Surjective - Bijective - injective and surjective Walk - edges and vertices can be reused
Path (or trail) - edges cannot be reused, vertices can be reused
Simple path (or path if using trail terminology) - edges and vertices cannot be reused Connected graph is a graph with a path between any two vertices
Strongly connected graph is a directed graph with a directed path between any two vertices in both directions
Weakly connected graph is a "not strongly connected" directed graph
Graph diameter is the length of a largest path out of the shortest paths between any two vertices

Polynomial can be represented in memory as an array of coefficients Polynomial can also be represented as arbitrary points such that Transformation from coefficients to points takes time
Transformation from points to coefficients also takes time, this is to be proved in HWs An algorithm for performing transformations between coefficients and points representations in timeAn algorithm for performing polynomial multiplication in time (and subsequently n-digit multiplication)Fill with zeroes up to degree and use FFT. The result is Naive multiplication, Compare and choose either solution. Divide into -sized chunks and perform FFT. There are iterations of FFT (). All and all, Running 2-SUM for each element. Let This means that can be represented as an array of coefficients 0, 1 of size , this takes time
We can calculate in using FFT and then check which coefficients are non-zero. This check takes , all and all, With the limitation of not using the same element twice, we simply check if the coefficient is larger than 1, not just

If Eran is tired, he is upset.
When Eran is not upset, he is not tired. If Eyal is happy, Anat is tall; and if Anat is tall, Haggai is cute.
If Eyal is happy, Haggai is cute. If I am vegan, then I eat quinoa and do not eat shawarma.
I do not eat quinoa only if I am not vegan, and I also do not eat shawarma
if I am vegan.
The next exercise deals with cards that have a symbol on both sides—an English
letter on one side and a natural number on the other. Four cards are placed on the
table, showing the symbols A, P, 2, and 3. Which cards should be flipped to check
the statement ”If there is one of the letters AEIOU on one side of the card, then on
the other side, there is an even number”? Justify well (why the cards you suggested
need to be flipped, and why the other cards do not need to be checked).
If there is a letter A on one side, then on the other is a natural number. If it's even, the statement holds, if not, the statement is false, thus we have to flip this card.
If there is a letter P on one side, then on the other is a natural number, if it's odd, the statement holds, if it's even, the statement still holds, thus we don't have to flip that card.
If there is a number 2 on one side, then on the other is a letter. If it's one of A,E,I,O or U, the statement holds, if it's not, the statement still holds, thus we don't have to flip this card.
If there is a number 3 on one side, then on the other is a letter. If it's not one of A,E,I,O or U, the statement holds, if it is, the statement is false, thus we have to flip this card. If I am tired or hungry, then I am irritable.
If I am not irritable, then I am not tired.
Conclusion: I am tired if and only if I am irritable. If the sun is shining, then all the roosters are crowing.
If my rooster, Kuki, is crowing, then the sun is shining.
Conclusion: The sun shines if and only if all the roosters are crowing
Let p, q be two statements such that the statement p → q has the value ”true.” In
this case, we say that p is a sufficient condition for q, and q is a necessary condition
for p. Formalize each of the following sections using appropriate predicates. In all
sections, the ”world” is the natural numbers; there is no need to state this.For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is prime” is a sufficient condition for ”the number n is odd.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is prime and greater than 2” is a sufficient and necessary condition for ”the number n is odd.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is divisible by 4” is a sufficient condition for ”the number n is even.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is even” is a necessary condition for ”the number n is divisible by 4.”]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/assignments/discrete-math/discrete-math-01.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Assignments/Discrete-math/Discrete-math 01.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:27:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discrete-math 10]]></title><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/assignments/discrete-math/discrete-math-10.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Assignments/Discrete-math/Discrete-math 10.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:27:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-structures 05]]></title><description><![CDATA[dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or (j &gt;= A[i-1] and dp[i-1][j - A[i-1]])

The central tendency - where is data concentrated
The dispersion (spread) - how far do extremities reach
In probability theory, these correspond to expected value (mean) and dispersion
Some single numerical value computed from a sample. This statistic summarizes some aspect of the data, i.e. center, spread, associationSummary statistic is called robust if small changes or few extreme observations have little influence on its value.The smallest fraction of the sample data that has to be replaced with an arbitrary extreme value in order to make the statistic take an arbitrary large (or small) value, i.e. the measure of how resistant statistic is to data contaminationSample variance measures the typical squared distance from the mean
Standard deviation expresses this deviation in the same units as the data.Why not use absolute values instead of squares? The answer is - we usually prefer smooth functions over non-smooth ones.It is important to note that standard deviation is not robust, it is easily inflated by an extreme value.
Squaring avoids cancellations between positive and negative differences
Squaring emphasizes data points that are further from the mean Using gives us an unbiased estimate on the true population variance
Quartile is each of the four equally-sized groups that the data sample can be divided into according to the distribution of a particular variable denotes the split-point of the first quartile from the rest (median of the lower half of the data) denotes the split-point of the fourth quartile from the rest (median of the higher half of the data)
Interquartile range is then defined as a difference measures the spread of the central half of the data and is much less affected by outliers than the standard deviation.
Hence, is more robust than the standard deviationThe rule states the following:-based "fences" are robust - they depend on medians, not on extreme values
For symmetric, light-tailed data, For heavy-tailed or contaminated data, stays stable, while can explode

For and the quantiles are respectively A horizontal shift between two ECDFs indicates a difference in location - the dataset whose ECDF is to the right tends to have larger values
A difference in steepness (a slope of steps) indicates a difference in spread - the steeper ECDF corresponds to a more concentrated distribution
If one ECDF is consistently below the other, one sample tends to produce larger observations (stochastic dominance) Positive - both grow
Negative - one grows, another falls
None - no visible pattern
Spurious - both depend on some hidden factor
To show these relations visually, we can use the Scatterplot Horizontal axis shows one variable (sometimes called an explanatory variable)
Vertical axis shows the other variable (sometimes called a response variable)
The overall pattern reveals direction, form, and strength of the relationship
An example of a positive relationship on a scatterplot:
HoursStudiedExamScore1234567891012345678910ScatterplotNote that scatterplots only show association, not causation(!!!)
Sometimes we wish to quantify the relationship with a single number instead.
The numerator measures how and move together
The denominator rescales it so that Note that non-linear trends cannot be observed using the sample correlation coefficient!
Having an observable trend, we can try to predict the value of a response variable given the value of an explanatory variable
Let us discuss linear trends and, correspondingly, linear regression.
We can make predictions using the fitted lineGiven a linear trend, a fitted line is a line that summarizes this trend, i.e. captures it's central tendency, not the details.
The fitted line provides the prediction value for each The difference between the actual value and the predicted one is called residual, Residual measures how far the actual data points are from the fitted line
To obtain the best fitted line we use algebraic regression, so called least-squares fit, the goal of this regression is to minimize the sum of squared residuals.Coefficient of determination is defined as follows is the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the fitted line For simple regression, The higher the coefficient of determination, the better predictive ability. measures the linear association, measures how well the fitted line fits.
Using a scatterplot of residuals against fitted values , we can analyze the pattern they form and verify whether a fitted line is appropriate for the data.
If residuals are random, scattered around 0, then the line fits well
A pattern (curve, funnel, etc.) indicates problems - nonlinearity or heteroscedasticity
If the pattern is observed, it is possible that applying a variable transformation would help, i.e. If not, a nonlinear model is probably necessary
But what if a pattern is not really a curve, funnel, etc., but a changing spread, meaning there is a relation between and ?
In this case, transformation or a weighted least-squares fit might help
If not, we can still fallback to a nonlinear modelThe least-squares fit uses squared deviations, this means that one large error ahs a huge impact on the total
Outliers can distort both and the correlation Outliers might also inflate or deflate The most important thing here is to perform a data cleanup - fixing or removing data errors
If the outlier is in fact an actual value and not a data error - use robust regression models

Columns used in GROUP BY can be present in the result set as is, but don't have to
Any other columns must only be used in some aggregate
SELECT product, SUM(price*quantity) AS salesPerProduct
FROM Purchase
WHERE date &gt;= '2020.01.01'
GROUP BY product
This query will return sum of sales since 2020 for each product
Some GROUP BY queries can be written without GROUP BY using sub-queries, although it is not really usefulHAVING clause is used in combination with GROUP BY and is roughly equivalent to WHERE for each group created by GROUP BY instead of a condition for the whole tableSELECT product, MAX(price) AS maxPrice
FROM Purchase
WHERE date &gt;= '2020.01.01'
GROUP BY product
HAVING MAX(price) &lt; 100 AND MIN(price) &gt; 10
Using HAVING without aggregation is usually pointless as it can be done with WHERE or a sub-query, or can have unexpected results, different from defining conditions on the whole tableQuote from Wikipedia
WHERE is taken into account at an earlier stage of a query execution, filtering the rows read from the tables. If a query contains GROUP BY, rows from the tables are grouped and aggregated. After the aggregating operation, HAVING is applied, filtering out the rows that don't match the specified conditions. Therefore, WHERE applies to data read from tables, and HAVING should only apply to aggregated data, which isn't known in the initial stage of a query. Author(login, name)
Wrote(login, title)
Find names of authors who wrote at least 10 documents
SELECT Author.name
FROM Author, Wrote
WHERE Author.login = Wrote.login
GROUP BY Author.login, Author.name
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= 10
Find the maximal number of articles that any author wroteSELECT MAX(nums.numArticles) AS maxArticles

orSELECT COUNT(*) AS maxArticles
FROM Wrote
GROUP BY Wrote.login
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= ALL (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Wrote GROUP BY Wrote.login)
NULL is a missing or unknown atomic value in the table
We can either allow NULLs or prohibit them in the table/column
Selection, is NULL = 2?
Distinct, are two NULLs distinct or not?
Joins, are two NULLs equal or not?
Intersect, are two NULLs equal or not?
...
To solve this problem, in SQL there are three(!) boolean values:
FALSE = 0
UNKNOWN = 0.5 (conceptually)
TRUE = 1
UNKNOWN is used specifically for comparisons with NULL AND TRUE AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
FALSE AND UNKNOWN = FALSE
UNKNOWN AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN OR TRUE OR UNKNOWN = TRUE
FALSE OR UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
UNKNOWN OR UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN NOT
- NOT UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
These can be interpreted (conceptually) as:
x AND y = min(x, y)
x OR y = max(x, y)
NOT x = 1 - x
Rows with the value of WHERE condition being UNKNOWN will not be returned
Operators IS NULL and IS NOT NULL check exactly what is written
If a value is equal (not equal) to NULL, then it returns TRUE, otherwise FALSEBenefits
Explicitly define join criteria and distinguish them from selection criteria
Avoid bugs like unintended cartesian products (i.e. forgotten join clause in WHERE)
SELECT Product.name, Purchase.store
FROM Product JOIN Purchase ON Product.name = Purchase.prodName
is equivalent toSELECT Product.name, Purchase.store
FROM Product, Purchase
WHERE Product.name = Purchase.prodName
Outer joins include rows from the first table that did not match any rows from the second table
LEFT OUTER JOIN, LEFT JOIN - for each rows on the left do a regular join if there is a match, or match with a row of NULLs from the right table
RIGHT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN - same as LEFT OUTER JOIN but symmetric
FULL OUTER JOIN - include non-matching rows from both left and right tables Missing from MySQL, but can be emulated INNER JOIN, JOIN - same as implicit join (with a joining condition!) Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Purchase(buyer, seller, store, product)
Company(cname, stockPrice, country)
Find people who bought anything from Lucy or bought products from a company whose stock price is over $50
SELECT DISTINCT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname JOIN Company AS c ON p.manufacturer = c.cname
WHERE pur.seller = 'Lucy' OR c.stockPrice &gt; 50
Let's talk about the last query, there is a problem:
What if we have a NULL somewhere?
Conditions in OR are asymmetric, that is they examine different tables, and they should not depend on the contents of other tables when joining. Any failure in the joining chain would break the query
Let's try using LEFT OUTER JOIN to eliminate this problem!SELECT DISTINCT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur LEFT JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname LEFT JOIN Company AS c ON p.manufacturer = c.cname
WHERE pur.seller = 'Lucy' OR c.stockPrice &gt; 50
Or by using UNION:(SELECT pur.buyer FROM Purchase AS pur WHERE pur.seller = 'Lucy') UNION
(SELECT pur.buyer FROM Purchase AS pur JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname JOIN Company AS c ON p.manufacturer = c.cname WHERE c.stockPrice &gt; 50)
Switch case clause in SQLSELECT product, CASE WHEN price &lt; 1500 THEN 'Low price' WHEN price BETWEEN 1500 AND 2000 THEN 'Medium price' WHEN price &gt; 2000 THEN 'High price' ELSE 'Unknown' END AS PriceCategory
...
Choose the first non-NULL value from the listSELECT COALESCE(p.category, 'misc') AS category, SUM(price*quantity) AS totalSales
FROM Purchase AS pur LEFT JOIN Product AS p ON pur.product = p.pname
GROUP BY COALESCE(p.category, 'misc') Purchase(pid, buyer, seller, product, date, price)
For each purchase, calculate the sum of all previous purchases of the same buyer
SELECT pur1.pid, COALESCE((SELECT SUM(pur2.price) FROM Purchase AS pur2 WHERE pur2.buyer = pur1.buyer AND pur2.date &lt; pur1.date ), 0) AS previousTotal
FROM Purchase AS pur1
Can we do this some other way?
For each row, open a "window" to other related rows
Similar to aggregate functions, but return a value for each row instead of each group
SELECT col1, col2, window_function(...) OVER([PARTITION BY] [ORDER BY]) AS new_column
FROM TableName window_function() can be an aggregate function or some other: RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUM, NTILE, LAG, LEAD OVER defines the window
- PARTITION BY (Optional) defines the associated group for each row
- ORDER BY (Optional) sets the order. When used, the window often ends with the current transaction
Previous query then becomes
SELECT pid, SUM(price) OVER ( PARTITION BY buyer ORDER BY date RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING AND 1 PRECEEDING ) AS previousTotal
FROM Purchase
Another example is
Student(name, dept, avgGrade, ...)
Find all the number one and two students with the highest average in each department. Include ties
SELECT ptable.name
FROM (SELECT name, dept, avgGrade, DENSE_RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY avgGrade DESC ) AS studentRank FROM Student) as ptable
WHERE ptable.studentRank &lt;= 2

The answer is foreign keys.
A column that is a reference to the key of another table, i.e. Product.manufacturer &lt;- Company.cname
Gives information and enforces constraints
SELECT *
FROM Department, Faculty
Yields the cartesian product of two tables, i.e. SELECT *
FROM Department, Faculty
WHERE dfaculty=fname
Yields the cartesian product with some constraints, i.e. SELECT R.A
FROM R, S, T
WHERE R.A=S.A OR R.A=T.A
Seemingly, we're looking for But what happens when one or tables are empty, i.e. T? Cartesian product is then also empty! So the query is not equivalent to Sometimes two relations have the same name for one or more columns. In this case, we're supposed to use the relation name to disambiguate the attribute, i.e. Person.address, Company.address instead of just address, addressQuestion - find all stores that sold at least one product that BestBuy store also sold?
Proposed query:SELECT DISTINCT store
FROM Purchase
WHERE store = 'BestBuy'
This query is obviously wrong, as it only returns BestBuy itself
We encounter a problem - we have to match two or more different rows on the same column in the same table
The solution is a self-join!SELECT DISTINCT store
FROM Purchase, Purchase
WHERE product = product AND store = 'BestBuy'
The problem is that all columns are now ambiguous
The solution to this problem is aliasing, or ASSELECT DISTINCT x.store
FROM Purchase AS x, Purchase AS y
WHERE x.product = y.product AND y.store = 'BestBuy'
And now the query actually works. The only question is - do we want to return BestBuy itself or not?SELECT DISTINCT x.store
FROM Purchase AS x, Purchase AS y
WHERE x.product = y.product AND y.store = 'BestBuy' AND x.store &lt;&gt; 'BestBuy'
It is also possible to rename attributes (columns) in the SELECT resulting table
Scope of the created "variable" is the entire query (for now)
Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Purchase(buyer, seller, store, product)
Company(cname, stockPrice, country)
Person(pername, phoneNumber, city)
Find all people who bought telephony productsSELECT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur, Product AS pr
WHERE pur.product = pr.pname AND pr.category = 'telephony'
Find names of people who bought American productsSELECT DISTINCT pur.buyer
FROM Purchase AS pur, Product AS pr, Company AS c
WHERE pur.product = pr.pname AND pr.manufacturer = c.cname AND c.country = 'USA'
Find names of people who bought American products and they live in SeattleSELECT DISTINCT per.pername
FROM Person AS per, Purchase AS pur, Product AS pr, Company AS c
WHERE per.pername = pur.buyer AND pur.product = pr.pname AND pr.manufacturer = c.cname AND c.country = 'USA' AND per.city = 'Seattle'
Find people who have both bought and sold somethingSELECT DISTINCT buy.buyer
FROM Purchase AS buy, Purchase AS sell
WHERE buy.buyer = sell.seller
Find a purchase involving a person from Seattle and a person from TokyoSELECT DISTINCT buy.buyer AS 'buyer', buy.seller AS 'seller', buy.store AS 'store', buy.product AS 'product'
FROM Purchase AS pur, Person AS buy, Person AS sell
WHERE pur.buyer = buy.pername AND pur.seller = sell.pername AND ( (buy.city = 'Seattle' AND sell.city = 'Tokyo') OR (buy.city = 'Tokyo' AND sell.city = 'Seattle') )
Union of two result tables with equal columns(!)
UNION returns distinct entries by default, use UNION ALL to keep them
Example, select all people who live in Seattle or bought something from BestBuy(SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle') UNION
(SELECT buyer as name FROM Purchase WHERE store='BestBuy')
Difference of two result tables with equal columns(!)
EXCEPT returns distinct entries
Example, select all people who live in Seattle and didn't buy anything from BestBuy(SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle') EXCEPT
(SELECT buyer as name FROM Purchase WHERE store='BestBuy')
Intersection of two result tables with equal columns(!)
INTERSECT returns distinct entries
Example, select all people who live in Seattle and bought something from BestBuy(SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle') INTERSECT
(SELECT buyer as name FROM Purchase WHERE store='BestBuy')
Subquery can be treated as an atomic value if and only if it returns a one-row and one-column resultSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.buyer = (SELECT name FROM Person WHERE ID = '123456789')
Checking if a value exists in the set
Subquery can return any number of results, but no errorSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.buyer IN (SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city='Seattle')
Subquery can also return multiple columnsSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE (Purchase.buyer, Purchase.store) IN (SELECT name, city FROM Person)
Quantifying over a subquery, i.e. Subquery must return a one-column resultSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.price &gt;= ALL (SELECT price FROM Purchase)
Quantifying over a subquery, i.e. Subquery must return a one-column resultSELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE Purchase.price &gt; ANY (SELECT price FROM Purchase)
Quantifying over a subquery, i.e. subquery is non-empty (or empty)SELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Person WHERE store=city); SELECT Purchase.product
FROM Purchase
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Person WHERE store=city);
Usage
Note that these clauses can be used almost everywhere, not just as part of a WHERE clause
More specifically, in WHERE, FROM, SELECT and HAVING
When added to a simple SELECT-FROM-WHERE query:
Computed over the result set
returns a single value (one row)
SQL supports the following:
SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG - single column
COUNT - any number of columns, counts only rows COUNT(DISTINCT ...) counts only rows, distinct by columns in ... ]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/databases/databases-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Databases/Databases 2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:04:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Databases 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[Books Database Systems : The complete Book (2nd edition)
SQL for Web nerds What is the goal of a database?
Store the data
Update the data
Fetch certain parts of the data
Database Management SystemRelational DBMSWhat is a DBMS?
A collection of files that store the data
A system that manages the files does all the above
Collection of Interfaces
Let us try to implement a courses repository without using a DBMS
We need to store
Students
Professors
Courses
Relations between students and courses, professors and courses, etc.
We can do a naive file-storage system:students.txt
ID, name, course list courses.txt
ID, name, professor, students list professors.txt
ID, name, course list
Which basic problems are there?
Lists inside lists, complex data layout
Data duplication
Ambiguous field names
Hard to update the data without rewriting the whole file
What about the following:
System crashes - how do we ensure data consistency in case of a crash in the middle of some operation?
Large data, e.g. 1Tb per file
Simultaneous access by multiple users
Complex queries - find all professors who teach some specific student that takes more first year classes than average, etc.
All, or almost all, of these problems have been addressed one way or another by existing DBMSs, with contributions of many excellent developers. Client tier - Clients connect to the DBMS and tell it what to do Server tier - Off-the-shelf program that manages data files, handles crashes, access control, concurrency, etc. Client tier send commands (queries) to Server tier and receives results Clients use some protocol to connect to the server and use a language to specify complex queries Relational DBMS
In the following notes we'll talk mainly about RDBMS
An example of such a language would be SQLSQL consists of two main parts
Data Definition language (DDL) - a way to define the structure of the data
Data Manipulation language (DML) - a way to work with the data
Data Control language (DCL) - a way to manage user permissions
Procedural extensions (PS-SQL, etc.)
It is specifying WHAT to do, not HOW to do it
This allows the user to not know how the data management is done, only how to interact with a DBMS, which is, in most cases, much easier
Start with defining structure of the data with DDLCREATE TABLE Students ( ID CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, Name CHAR(30), Degree CHAR(20), ...);
And continue with DML to populate the dataINSERT INTO Students
VALUES('123456789', 'Alice Jones', 'Undergraduate', ...);
Multiple tables allow us to represent relations between different entities (tables)Where Takes is a relation table representing relation "Student takes Course"
Query/DML/DDL compiler - parse language and translate into logical execution steps
Optimizer - optimize queries execution
Execution engine
Storage management
Transaction management - concurrency and recovery Atomic types - int, char, date, etc.
Table - each cell in a table contains one atomic value
No nesting, except when including a nested document as an atomic value, e.g. XML document Each record (row, tuple) is an ordered list of atomic values (and NULLs)
Each table is an unordered bag of records, at least from the client perspective There can be duplicate records (theoretically)
No order (theoretically) A collection of atomic values in all records with the same name in the table is called a column
Notation is as follows
Students(ID, Name, Degree)
A key is an attribute or a set of attributes with unique value
No two records may have the same key
This can be explained as "KEY defines ATTRIBUTES", i.e. ID defines student name and degree
Classrooms(Building, Room, Capacity, Projector)
Here, key is a set of two attributes - building and room define classroom capacity and projector
Basic form of a select query is as followsSELECT attributes
FROM relations
WHERE conditions for each record Usual meaning for numbers
Lexicographic order for CHAR and VARCHAR
Chronological ordering for dates and times Special functions Arithmetic operations on numbers
Pattern matching on text
Special date functions
DBMS dependent (specific) Clause connectives, e.g. AND, OR, etc.
LIKE - pattern matching s LIKE p - s matches pattern p
p may contain two types of wildcards % - any sequence of characters
_ - any single character Case sensitivity - depends on DBMS Select only distinct records, i.e.SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM Product
will only return all distinct categories, without repetitions
Selecting distinct multiple columns will result in all distinct combinations of these columnsSELECT pname, price, manufacturer
FROM product
WHERE category='Gadgets' AND price &gt; 50
ORDER BY price, pname DESC/ASC modifier to enforce descending/ascending order, ASC is the default
Order is lexicographic by columns
Ordering is done in the post processing, after the resulting rows have been selected
Additionally, it is possible to add LIMIT n clause that limits the resulting set to n rows
How do we connect two or more tables in a query? We identify pairs of records that correspond to each other in different tables, e.g. by the value of some "shared" column
Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Company(cname, stockprice, country)
A basic example would be "Find all products produced in Japan under 200$"SELECT pname, price
FROM Product, Company
WHERE manufacturer=cname AND country='Japan' AND price &lt;= 200;
Another example "Find all countries that manufacture some product in 'Gadgets' category"SELECT country
FROM Product, Company
WHERE manufacturer=cname AND category='Gadgets'
Does this work properly? No! Join creates records containing columns from both tables, so in our case if there are multiple 'Gadgets' products produced in the same country, there will be multiple repetitions of that country in the answer. We need DISTINCT!SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM Product, Company
WHERE manufacturer=cname AND category='Gadgets'
One more example!
Product(pname, price, category, manufacturer)
Purchase(buyer, seller, store, product)
Person(persname, phoneNumber, city)
"Find names of people living in Seattle that bought some product in the 'Gadgets' category, and the names of the stores from which they bought that product"
SELECT DISTINCT persname, store
FROM Person, Purchase, Product
WHERE persname=buyer AND product=pname AND city='Seattle' AND category='Gadgets'

Right child is always "greater" than the parent Node without children is called a Leaf Repetitions are usually not allowed
This structure forms an ever widening tree-like pattern Branch is a "path" from the root to one of the leaves Tree is called balanced if length of all it's branches is the same, in this case, length of branches is called the Height of the tree This operation is usually recursive, stepping to the left or to the right each call until we find the Node or get to a leafpublic Node searchBST(Node root, Node toFind) { if (root == null) { return root; } if (toFind == root) { return root; } else if (toFind &lt; root) { return this.searchBST(root.left, toFind); } else { return this.searchBST(root.right, toFind); }
}
This operation is usually recursive, stepping to the left or to the right each call until we get to the leafpublic Node insertNodeBST(Node root, Node new) { if (root == null) { // new becomes root return new; } if (new &lt; root) { root.left = this.insertNodeBST(root.left, new); } else if (new &gt; root) { root.left = this.insertNodeBST(root.right, new); } return root;
}
This operation is usually recursive, searching for an element to delete and, when found, adjusting tree as follows:
If the Node to delete has one child - it is just replaced by it
If the Node has two children - it's immediate successor replaces it
public Node removeNodeBST(Node root, Node toDelete) if (!root) { return root; } if (toDelete &lt; root) { root.left = removeNodeBST(root.left, toDelete); } else if (toDelete &gt; root) { root.right = removeNodeBST(root.right, toDelete); } else { // one right child or zero children if (root.left == null) { return root.right; } // one left child or zero children if (root.right == null) { return root.left; } // two children Node successor = root.right; while (successor.left) { successor = successor.left; } // copy successor data to root root.data = successor.data; // delete successor root.right = removeNodeBST(root.right, successor); } return root; InOrder Traversal (Left, Root, Right) - visits nodes in ascending order, sorted so to say
PreOrder Traversal (Root, Left, Right) - useful for creating a copy of the tree
PostOrder Traversal (Left, Right, Root) - used for deleting the tree efficiently
BST traversals are usually recursive but can be implemented using a stack instead
Concatenation is the process of merging two BSTs, T1​ and T2​, into a single BST while preserving the BST property.
Conditions:
Given two BSTs: T1​ contains elements smaller than all elements in T2​.
T2​ contains elements greater than all elements in T1​. An optional pivot element may be provided to maintain balance. Find the maximum element in T1​. Remove this maximum element from T1​.
Make the removed element the new root. Attach T1 as the left subtree and T2 as the right subtree. Start at the root of the taller tree (let’s say T1​).
Traverse down the right spine until reaching a node where the height of the subtree matches that of T2​.
Attach T2​ as the right child of this node.
Rebalance the tree if necessary.
Splitting a BST means dividing it into two separate BSTs based on a given split value x. The goal is:
T1​ should contain all elements ≤ x.
T2​ should contain all elements &gt; x. Search for x in the BST: If x exists, remove it and make it a pivot.
If x doesn’t exist, proceed with the nearest node. Recursive Splitting: If x is smaller than the root: Recursively split the left subtree. Attach the right subtree of the split to the right subtree of the root. If x is larger than the root: Recursively split the right subtree. Attach the left subtree of the split to the left subtree of the root. Balancing Step (if needed): If an AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree is used, rebalancing may be required. ]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/data-structures/data-structures-3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Data-structures/Data-structures 3.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:04:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-structures 2]]></title><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/lectures/data-structures/data-structures-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lectures/Data-structures/Data-structures 2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:04:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-structures 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[i = 1 # 1 time

Word is part of automata language if and only if there exists a sequence of transitions such that automata finishes in the accepting stateThis is a variation of a non-deterministic automata that allows changing the state without reading any input, it is denoted as a transition.

Equivalence relation - reflexive, symmetric, transitive
Partial order - reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive
Full order - partial order and Examples or orders include Injective - Surjective - Bijective - injective and surjective Walk - edges and vertices can be reused
Path (or trail) - edges cannot be reused, vertices can be reused
Simple path (or path if using trail terminology) - edges and vertices cannot be reused Connected graph is a graph with a path between any two vertices
Strongly connected graph is a directed graph with a directed path between any two vertices in both directions
Weakly connected graph is a "not strongly connected" directed graph
Graph diameter is the length of a largest path out of the shortest paths between any two vertices

Polynomial can be represented in memory as an array of coefficients Polynomial can also be represented as arbitrary points such that Transformation from coefficients to points takes time
Transformation from points to coefficients also takes time, this is to be proved in HWs An algorithm for performing transformations between coefficients and points representations in timeAn algorithm for performing polynomial multiplication in time (and subsequently n-digit multiplication)Fill with zeroes up to degree and use FFT. The result is Naive multiplication, Compare and choose either solution. Divide into -sized chunks and perform FFT. There are iterations of FFT (). All and all, Running 2-SUM for each element. Let This means that can be represented as an array of coefficients 0, 1 of size , this takes time
We can calculate in using FFT and then check which coefficients are non-zero. This check takes , all and all, With the limitation of not using the same element twice, we simply check if the coefficient is larger than 1, not just

If Eran is tired, he is upset.
When Eran is not upset, he is not tired. If Eyal is happy, Anat is tall; and if Anat is tall, Haggai is cute.
If Eyal is happy, Haggai is cute. If I am vegan, then I eat quinoa and do not eat shawarma.
I do not eat quinoa only if I am not vegan, and I also do not eat shawarma
if I am vegan.
The next exercise deals with cards that have a symbol on both sides—an English
letter on one side and a natural number on the other. Four cards are placed on the
table, showing the symbols A, P, 2, and 3. Which cards should be flipped to check
the statement ”If there is one of the letters AEIOU on one side of the card, then on
the other side, there is an even number”? Justify well (why the cards you suggested
need to be flipped, and why the other cards do not need to be checked).
If there is a letter A on one side, then on the other is a natural number. If it's even, the statement holds, if not, the statement is false, thus we have to flip this card.
If there is a letter P on one side, then on the other is a natural number, if it's odd, the statement holds, if it's even, the statement still holds, thus we don't have to flip that card.
If there is a number 2 on one side, then on the other is a letter. If it's one of A,E,I,O or U, the statement holds, if it's not, the statement still holds, thus we don't have to flip this card.
If there is a number 3 on one side, then on the other is a letter. If it's not one of A,E,I,O or U, the statement holds, if it is, the statement is false, thus we have to flip this card. If I am tired or hungry, then I am irritable.
If I am not irritable, then I am not tired.
Conclusion: I am tired if and only if I am irritable. If the sun is shining, then all the roosters are crowing.
If my rooster, Kuki, is crowing, then the sun is shining.
Conclusion: The sun shines if and only if all the roosters are crowing
Let p, q be two statements such that the statement p → q has the value ”true.” In
this case, we say that p is a sufficient condition for q, and q is a necessary condition
for p. Formalize each of the following sections using appropriate predicates. In all
sections, the ”world” is the natural numbers; there is no need to state this.For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is prime” is a sufficient condition for ”the number n is odd.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is prime and greater than 2” is a sufficient and necessary condition for ”the number n is odd.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is divisible by 4” is a sufficient condition for ”the number n is even.”For every natural number n, the statement ”the number n is even” is a necessary condition for ”the number n is divisible by 4.”]]></description><link>https://cub11k-biu.github.io/obsidian-notes/assignments/discrete-math/discrete-math-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Assignments/Discrete-math/Discrete-math 1.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Konstantin Ostashenko]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:04:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-structures 5]]></title><description><![CDATA[dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or (j &gt;= A[i-1] and dp[i-1][j - A[i-1]])
